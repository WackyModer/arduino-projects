Parts: 5 M-to-F wires, 5 M-to-M wires, 1 breadboard, 2 mechanical switches (buttons),  1 dotmatrix module, 1 MEGA2560 arduino

REQUIREMENTS: Basic knowledge of how to use a breadboard.

Setup:

With the dotmatrix module connect the VCC prong with a to 5V.
Connect the GND prong to the GND next to the 5V.
Connect the DIN prong to the PWM 12 pin.
Connect the CS prong to the PWM 11 pin.
Connect the CLK pront to the PWM 10 pin.

Breadboard:

Place both mechanical switches next to eachother a comfterable distance appart (these will be your "controls").
Run a wire from GND (I use GND next to PWM) to the side of the breadboard.
Run a wire from the grounded part of the breadboard to the [right or left side of the] mechanical switch.
Do previous step for both switches.
Connect the 9 pin in PWM to the opposite side of the LEFT mechanical switch that you plugged the grounded wire to.
Connect the 8 pin in PWM to the opposite side of the RIGHT mechanical switch that you plugged the grounded wire to.

Upload the snake.ino file to the arduino.
